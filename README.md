# assignment_react_restaurant

Name: Eric & Dan

Stuff to do:

Navbar - links to sections on the same page
Header - include an image and a heading at a minimum (e.g., jumbotron)
Reservation form - create the form and input markup though it will not be functional yet. Later in the course, you can try your hand at making in work.
Menu - created from a JavaScript object with at least item name, description, and price
